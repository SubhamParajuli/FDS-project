Documentation

🚀 Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Checking data distribution, feature correlations, and assumption validation.
Machine Learning Models:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Model Evaluation: Using MSE, RMSE, and R² score for both train and test data.
Visualization: Residual plots, feature importance analysis, and performance comparisons.
📊 Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score. Below is an example result:

Model	Dataset	MSE	RMSE	R² Score
Linear Regression	Train	4500	67.1	0.85
Linear Regression	Test	5200	72.1	0.78
Random Forest	Train	1200	34.6	0.98
Random Forest	Test	3100	55.7	0.89
